# Coupon-Collector

This is the final project for Info430 at the University of Washington. We built a relational database for storing coupon information and related user information generated by mock data. We implemented stored procedures, synthetic transactions, business rules, various subqueries, views, and included proper error-handling to simulate a real business environment.
